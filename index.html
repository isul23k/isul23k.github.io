<small>2024_<b>Tränenpalast</b>_this piece was composed for the 192 speaker wave-field soundsystem installed at the New Music Lab in Amare for the Wave Field Festival. The piece centers around the former border-crossing point between East and West Germany at Berlin’s Friedrichstraße. Here, a glass panelled building was the site of German division and the final threshold for the departing to say goodbye. After the fall of the Soviet Bloc, it resigned its duties of border control and reopened its doors as a concert hall and cultural venue for the reforming city. The piece uses personal recordings of the many train rides made between Berlin and The Hague in 2023 and 2024. After relocating to the Netherlands while half of my life remained in Berlin, the long train rides became a liminal space of contemplation. Friedrichstraße station became a site of arrival, departure; of longing, separation, reconnection, and remembrance of a history that still resonates today.  </small><br>

<small>2024_<b>Breathing Spaces</b>_was a groupshow of up-and-coming sound artists selected for the Sonic Acts Biennale 2024. The meetings were held at Zone2Source artspace in Amsterdam and involved investigations of sound & space within the context of the 2024 biennale programme through the mentorship of composer and educator, Ji Youn Kang. Here, I developed and presented the performance/installation "The Backyard", a collection of field-recordings made during the working period played-back through an open wireless feedback system with FM transmitters and receivers that were mapped through a Max patch for delays and textures. The installation interlaced a sound journal of the residency with the live exhibition space and radio on-air. </small><br>

<small>2024_<b>The Eternal Parent</b>_is an experimental oprah for voice and electronics, a collaboration with Viktoria Nikolova and commissioned by Sophia Underground. The performance in three parts puts into question the deep etchings of storytelling archetypes and spiritual tropes within the collective consciousness. Through a relentless feedback loop operating on a sonic plane, we have merged cultural, visual and auditory elements, perpetually folding them back into themselves until they metamorphose into an unrecognisable new narrative state. </small><br>

<small>2023_<b>Anatomic Buoyancies</b>_is a collection of work arranged from material collected during Justin Bennett's field-recording workshop (The Hague). The works seek to explore the characteristics of each microphone through the choice of environment<sup>2</sup> they are placed inside. Each microphone embodies a unique shape and size, bandwidth, field of capture, and usability requirements that situates it in unique contexts. The (self-proclaimed) objective was to explore the characteristics of microphones presented to us, through imagining a suitable environment to capture. The following recordings were complied and composed during a week's excursion through the city, shifting sands, an elevated dinner, and a practise of non-listening.

<small>2022_<b>Kairos</b>_is a sound collage commissioned for Refuge Radio Berlin as a part of Alifiyah Imani's artistic research on Sonic Rituals. The piece constructs sonic clusters of events that happened in 2022 as an interpretation of kairos, or non-linear time, and how memories take on the retrospective marker of time. The composed situations play with the proximities of encounter with the social-political landscape of Berlin. By drawing in major events: the Artemis launch, war on Ukraine, feminist protests in Iran, and how these remembrances entwine with our ordinary soundscapes, it achieves an <u>abstracted journalism</u>  or journaling of events from an individual perspective. The audio samples that mark each sonic event was taken from Instagram. Full stream <a href="https://refugeworldwide.com/radio/sonic-rituals-alifiyah-12-dec-2022" target="_blank">here</a>.</small>

<small>2022_<b>Floating basin</b>_is a sound essay broadcasted on Cashmere Radio as a part of a cumulative work on Diasporic Listening to Berlin soundscapes with artist Yara Mekawei. The site chosen for this investigation is Floating <s>University</s>, a public intervention and recreation space above the rainwater retention basin of the old Templehofer airport. It is an urban sanctuary for wildlife and microbials. Inspired by their resistance to uphold against urban redevelopment pressures and the societal activation of post-COVID lockdown, the essay uses this site as a departure point to question the meaning of change.

<small>2020_<b>Returning to zero time</b>_an immersive biofeedback environment was installed for the Reeperbahn Festival, in Hamburg Germany. Taking the anatomic womb as inspiration, audio and visual impulses are tuned to the average heart rate of visitors as an investigation on the social experience of synchronisation during the first COVID lockdown. Commissioned for the artist collective Frank Nubala.</small><br>
