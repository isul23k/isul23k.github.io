<small>2023_<b>Anatomic buoyancies</b>_is a collection of work arranged from material collected during Justin Bennett's field-recording workshop (The Hague). The works seek to explore the characteristics of each microphone through the choice of environment<sup>2</sup> they are placed inside. Each microphone embodies a unique shape and size, bandwidth, field of capture, and usability requirements that situates it in unique contexts. I thought it would be a fun exercise to imagine an unusual environment for each microphone to capture. The collection is still in progress.</small>

<small>2023_<b>Slowing walking down a suburban street</b>_is a sonic elaboration on the soundscape of a park frequently visited as a kid in suburban New Zealand. The mix-media sound piece utilises field-recordings and synthesis techniques to narrate the emotionalities of encounter- returning to the site as an adult.</small>

<small>2022_<b>Kairos</b>_is a sound collage commissioned for Refuge Radio Berlin as a part of Alifiyah Imani's artistic research on Sonic Rituals. The piece constructs sonic clusters of events that happened in 2022 as an interpretation of kairos, or non-linear time, and how memories take on the retrospective marker of time. The composed situations play with the proximities of encounter with the social-political landscape of Berlin. By drawing in major events: the Artemis launch, war on Ukraine, feminist protests in Iran, and how these remembrances entwine with our ordinary soundscapes, it achieves an abstracted journalism or journaling of events from an individual perspective. The audio samples that mark each sonic event was taken from Instagram.</small>

<small>2022_<b>Floating basin</b>_is a sound essay broadcasted on Cashmere Radio as a part of a cumulative work on Diasporic Listening to Berlin soundscapes with artist Yara Mekawei. Floating <s>University</s>, is a public intervention site above the rainwater retention basin of the old Templehofer airport and an urban sanctuary for wildlife and microbials. Inspired by their resistance to uphold against urban redevelopment pressures and the societal activation of post-COVID lockdown, the essay uses this site as a departure point to question the meaning of change.</small>

<small>2020_<b>Returning to zero time</b>_an immersive biofeedback environment was installed for the Reeperbahn Festival, in Hamburg Germany. Taking the anatomic womb as inspiration, audio and visual impulses are tuned to the average heart rate of visitors as an investigation on the social experience of synchronisation during the first COVID lockdown. Commissioned for the artist collective Frank Nubala.</small><br>
