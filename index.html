<small>2020_<b>The Eternal Parent</b>is an experimental oprah for voice and electronics, a collaboration with Viktoria Nikolova and commissioned by the Sophia Underground. The performance in three parts puts into question the deep etchings of storytelling archetypes and spiritual tropes within the collective consciousness. Through a relentless feedback loop operating on a sonic plane, we merge cultural, visual and auditory elements, perpetually folding them back into themselves until they metamorphose into an unrecognisable new narrative state. </small><br>

<small>2023_<b>Slowing walking down a suburban street</b>_is a sonic elaboration on the soundscape of a park frequently visited as a kid in suburban New Zealand. The mix-media sound piece utilises field-recordings, piano and synthesis techniques to narrate the emotionalities of encounter- returning to the site as a grownup.</small>

<small>2022_<b>Kairos</b>_is a sound collage commissioned for Refuge Radio Berlin as a part of Alifiyah Imani's artistic research on Sonic Rituals. The piece constructs sonic clusters of events that happened in 2022 as an interpretation of kairos, or non-linear time, and how memories take on the retrospective marker of time. The composed situations play with the proximities of encounter with the social-political landscape of Berlin. By drawing in major events: the Artemis launch, war on Ukraine, feminist protests in Iran, and how these remembrances entwine with our ordinary soundscapes, it achieves an <u>abstracted journalism</u>  or journaling of events from an individual perspective. The audio samples that mark each sonic event was taken from Instagram.</small>

<small>2022_<b>Floating basin</b>_is a sound essay broadcasted on Cashmere Radio as a part of a cumulative work on Diasporic Listening to Berlin soundscapes with artist Yara Mekawei. Floating <s>University</s>, is a public intervention site above the rainwater retention basin of the old Templehofer airport and an urban sanctuary for wildlife and microbials. Inspired by their resistance to uphold against urban redevelopment pressures and the societal activation of post-COVID lockdown, the essay uses this site as a departure point to question the meaning of change.</small>
